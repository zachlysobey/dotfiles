# Zach's dotfiles

## Some random notes

### Homebrew

I use homebrew to install some stuff.

#### a sample of stuff I install with brew:

-   `brew install nvm`
-   `brew install yarn`
-   `brew install tree`

### Aliasing stuff to the home directory

Example:

```sh
ln -s /Users/zachlysobey/work/dotfiles/.npmrc ~/.npmrc
```
